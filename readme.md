# SHS Strand Decision-Making Application

This is a Python Tkinter application designed to help students who are undecided about which Senior High School (SHS) strand to pursue. By taking a personalized quiz, students receive a recommendation for the strand that best aligns with their interests, goals, and preferences.

## SHS Strands

The application evaluates responses and suggests one of the following SHS strands:

- **GAS (General Academic Strand)**: Ideal for students who want a broader scope of subjects and haven't chosen a specific path.
- **HUMSS (Humanities and Social Sciences)**: Best suited for students interested in the arts, literature, history, and social sciences.
- **STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics)**: Perfect for students with a strong interest in math and science, often leading to technical and medical fields.
- **ABM (Accountancy, Business, and Management)**: Tailored for students who aspire to pursue business, finance, and management careers.
- **ICT (Information and Communications Technology)**: Suitable for students interested in technology, programming, and communications.
